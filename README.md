## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- CSS Grid
-css block
- Javascript
- Typescript

### What I learned

* Dynamically render data using TypeScript and the DOM
* Handle API responses
* Build a modal with dynamic content including borders that navigate to other countries
* Use CSS variables for theme switching (light and dark mode)


### Continued development
* Improve accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)

* Add smooth transitions when opening/closing the modal

* Explore using a frontend framework like React to simplify state management
